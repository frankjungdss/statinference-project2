statinference-031 project 2

In this project we will analyse the ToothGrowth dataset to compare odontoblast
growth by supplement and dosage. The question we want to answer is: Does the
delivery method of supplements effect mean odontoblast growth? i.e. Is there any
measurable difference in means of growth between these supplements and dosages?
