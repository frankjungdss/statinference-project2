## Synopsis

In this project we will analyse the 
[ToothGrowth](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/ToothGrowth.html)
dataset to compare tooth growth by supplement and dose. The question we want to 
answer is: Does the delivery method of Vitamin C supplements effect tooth
growth?

```{r setoptions, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
require(knitr, quietly = TRUE)
require(ggplot2, quietly = TRUE)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, cache = TRUE, cache.path = "cache/", fig.path = "figure/")
```

## Exploratory Analysis

```{r loaddata, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
summary(ToothGrowth)
```
